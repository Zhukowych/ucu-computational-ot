    "To present this as a linear programming problem, as we already have the objective function $Z = \\langle P, C \\rangle$, we need to properly encode the constraints on $P$ as a matrix-vector equality. This can be achieved by:\n",
    "1) Constructing $\\mathbf{p} = vec(P)$, which basically means that we transform matrix $P$ into a vector by stacking its columns one over another;\n",
    "2) Constructing the matrix representing our constraint equations - it is done using the formula $A = \\bigl( \\begin{matrix}\\mathbf{1_m}\\otimes I_n\\\\ I_m \\otimes \\mathbf{1_n^T}\\end{matrix} \\bigr)$. $\\otimes$ in this formula corresponds to Kronecker's product, in which we multiply each element of the first matrix by the second matrix. As a result, $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(n+m)*nm}$ and encodes all $n+m$ contraints on each row and column of $P$.\n",
    "3) Combining the previous two steps, we get the system $A\\mathbf{p}= \\bigl[ \\begin{matrix} \\mathbf{a} \\\\ \\mathbf{b} \\end{matrix} \\bigr]$. The only thing left to note is that $\\mathbb{p} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{nm}_{+}$.\n",
